# Simple shooting game

* Sept 21, 2019
	* Completed phase 1
		* Shooting mechanic complete
		* Start/end prompts
	* Phase 2 to do:
		* Code structure (splitting up classes/using design patterns)
		* Sprites an sprite animation
		* Start/end screens (not prompts)
	* Phase 3 to do (maybe):
		* Code clean up / optimization
		* Additional features (pausing / different enemy, player, projectile sprites)
